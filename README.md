This project aims to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and other car attributes. 
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can assist car buyers, sellers, and dealerships in estimating fair market prices for used cars.

The used car market is highly dynamic, and determining the fair price of a car can be challenging due to various factors such as brand, age, mileage, condition, and market trends. This project addresses the following problem:

"Given a set of car attributes, can we accurately predict the selling price of a used car?"

The solution can be used by car dealerships, online car-selling platforms, or individual buyers/sellers to estimate car prices and make informed decisions.
